# The YAML file is a lightweight markup language file that supports all
# ROS parameter types. It's used by rosparam to load static parameters to
# the Parameter Server, which are commonly used to initialize part of a
# system and rarely change on run-time. Sometimes the user modifies this
# file before starting a node. This file is usually in the /config subdirectory
# of a package. Note that when dynamic reconfiguration is implemented for
# a package, most parameters will be dynamic, making this file barely used.
